# Credit-risk-default-prediction: Project overview
This is a repository for Home Credit Default Risk competition that was hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). The objective of this competition was to use data from various sources like credit bureau, previous loan applications, previous loan performance, and current application data in order to predict the probability of default of the applicant. The output of this model (in form of scores or risk bands) can then be used to make a credit decision (approve/reject) regarding the application.
